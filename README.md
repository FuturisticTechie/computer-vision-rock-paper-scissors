# Computer Vision RPS

## Project description

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock.

After a 3 second counddown, the player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. This is repeated until a player achieves 3 wins.

In building the code for this project I got to use some of the python skills I learnt and additionally learnt about the use of numpy arrays. This particualr project was challenging due to the amount of unfamiliar code (for example involving video capture code) but it was rewarding and fun to work with that.
